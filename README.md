###step-by-step.js
-



A little step by step to teach something. It's like Power point presentation but only for web.


###Why not GIFs?
This plugin is to you make some step by step of something. I really like GIFs to show some code tip, but some times i need to have see it in loop if i have past some important screen.


###Why not Video tags?

Make videos to show Tips is really usefull but, is too much to lower conections and olders browsers.

###WHAT IS THE SOLUTION?
Well, a image sequencials is a little solution that i found to teach some code and TI tips. It's usefull like animated GIFs and controlable like Videos PLUS is very light to all browsers.

This is a component to my EAD project called CANOA. It's not Open source (yet) but i'm trying so hard to make tools to teach every body using web.

I hope you enjoy ;-)
